# Leap Years
# by CodeChum Admin

# Write a program that takes an integer year as input and performs the following steps to determine if the year is a leap year:

# Checks if year is divisible by 4 (i.e., year % 4 == 0) to check if it's a multiple of 4.
# Checks if year is not divisible by 100 (i.e., year % 100 != 0) to exclude years that are multiples of 100 but not multiples of 400.
# Checks if year is divisible by 400 (i.e., year % 400 == 0) to include years that are multiples of 400.
# Input: An integer, year, representing a year.
 

# The program should print "Year is a leap year." if condition is met. Otherwise, do nothing.

# Sample Output 1

# Enter the year: 2000
# Year is a leap year.
# Sample Output 2

# Enter the year: 2024
# Year is a leap year.
# Sample Output 3

# Enter the year: 1999
year = int(input("Enter the year: "))
if (year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print("Year is a leap year.")
